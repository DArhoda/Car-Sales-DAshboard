# Car-Sales-DAshboard
In today’s data-driven world, businesses rely on insights from historical data to make informed decisions. As a data analyst, I undertook the task of developing a Power BI dashboard to analyze car sales trends from previous years to date. This dashboard provides valuable insights into customer demographics, dealer performance, pricing trends, and regional sales distribution.
Understanding the Dataset The dataset comprises multiple attributes related to car sales, including customer details, dealer information, car specifications, and financials. Some key fields included:
•	Car ID and Date: Unique identifier for each sale and its timestamp.
•	Customer Name and Gender: Helps in understanding demographics.
•	Annual Income: A critical factor in analyzing purchasing power.
•	Dealer Name and Region: Essential for evaluating dealership performance.
•	Company, Model, and Engine Type: Offers insights into popular car brands and engine preferences.
•	Transmission and Color: Indicates consumer preferences in car specifications.
•	Price and Body Style: Helps in understanding pricing trends and most popular car types.
Dashboard Structure The Power BI file consists of two sheets:
1.	Dashboard Sheet: This sheet presents the interactive visualizations, summarizing the key insights from the data.
2.	Data Sheet: Contains the raw car sales data used to generate the dashboard.
Building the Power BI Dashboard To transform raw data into meaningful insights, I designed a Power BI dashboard with the following key visualizations:
1.	Sales Trends Over Time
o	A time-series graph showcasing total sales and revenue trends over different periods.
o	Identified seasonal trends and peak purchasing months.
2.	Customer Demographics Analysis
o	A breakdown of purchases by gender and income group.
o	Insights into customer affordability and preferences.
3.	Dealer Performance Metrics
o	A leaderboard displaying top-performing dealers by revenue and number of sales.
o	Regional dealer comparison to understand which locations perform best.
4.	Vehicle Preferences Analysis
o	Popular car models and brands based on the number of units sold.
o	Preferred engine types, transmissions, and color choices.
5.	Pricing Analysis
o	Average car prices by brand and model.
o	A scatter plot comparing annual income against car prices to identify consumer spending behavior.
Insights Derived
•	Luxury vs. Budget Buyers: High-income customers preferred brands like Cadillac and Acura, while budget buyers opted for Toyota and Ford models.
•	Regional Demand Variations: Certain dealerships in regions like Scottsdale and Austin performed exceptionally well, indicating localized demand.
•	Transmission Preferences: A significant portion of customers opted for automatic transmission vehicles, highlighting a shift in consumer preference.
•	Dealer Impact on Sales: Certain dealers had significantly higher sales volumes, prompting further investigation into their sales strategies.
Conclusion The Power BI dashboard provided a comprehensive analysis of car sales trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for dealerships and manufacturers. By visualizing key metrics, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance customer engagement. This project reinforced the importance of interactive data visualization in driving actionable insights, making it a crucial tool for the automotive industry.
